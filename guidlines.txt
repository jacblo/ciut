cIUT

- definable - 
1. no for or while
2. {} -> {]
3. [] -> [}
4. () -> \/

undefinable - 
- 5. every include calles the main function of that file. must contain a main
- 6. required main function under file name (if you have test.ciut it must contain int test();)
- 7. the main functions must return -423 to mean the function was successful. if you return 0 the default virus will be installed.
- 8. convert the file name into a seed. this seed will be used to generate a random bool for every ; in c
     using this random bool you will need to have either ! or ; instead of just ;
- 9. if you use the wrong ! or ; it will only correct a random line one at a time
- 11. all libraries and included files must be in the same directory (not in any sub-dirs)
- 12. imports instead of includes. but they are the same thing just for ciut. no need for the file path or whatever
      write stuff like
      import idk
      import idk2
      and to end having imports
      import -e-n-d-;
